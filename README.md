# Construction-Data-Management-System
This is a SQL case study exploring the construction industry:  I started by generating the initial business idea, then went on to set up the database structure and fill it with contractor, project, and client information. During this process, I also developed a revenue model for the project.  Using SQL, I conducted analysis on the data.
